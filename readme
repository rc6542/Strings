What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Figuring the stuff out wasn't too fun, but it was definitely helpful in
teaching me how to use pointer notation, since we were exposed to array
notation previously in Java with 126 and 226.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, since both array and pointer notations ultimately refer to pointers
towards the arrays, there is no information about the allocated size of
pcDest. Hence, you cannot call assert to verify the memory area is large
enough because you need to know the size of the destination beforehand.
You would have to probably use the heap and dynamic memory or add an 
additional argument that serves as the max size of the memory area.
